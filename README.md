# ABM Workshop @ Stockerlab - 26.04.2023
Collection of scripts for the simulation of bacterial motility and chemotaxis.


To download these scripts:
- **From the browser**:
  - Click on `Code` (top right)
  - Download ZIP
  - Unzip into your desired directory

- **From the command line**:
  - `cd` into your desired directory
  - `git clone https://github.com/mastrof/StockerlabWS2023_BacterialSimulations.git`

Once you have cloned the repository:
- start a `Julia` REPL into the directory
- enter in Pkg mode by writing `]` (the Julia prompt should now end in `pkg>`)
- activate the environment with `activate .` (the prompt should now become `(StockerlabWS2023_BacterialSimulations) pkg>`)
- while still in Pkg mode, download all the required dependencies with `instantiate`, it can take some minutes

If everything went smooth, you now should be ready to run any of the scripts.
